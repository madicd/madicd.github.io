Being new to blogging, I try to remember the topics I always wanted to write about, but, as many, procrasinted.

As I have invested **over 300 hours** in SQL injection, I thought it might be a good start.

First post of the series will cover the interactive tools I have used to make the learning more fun.

## Juice Shop

[Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/) is an open-source web application
representing an insecure online shop. Ever-growing popularity of e-commerce makes the domain quite relevant. 

It was created by OWASP
organization and contains 100 challenges of varying
difficulty where the user is supposed to exploit the underlying vulnerabilities.
**SQL injection is covered by 7 of them.**

## Hack The Box

[Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/) is training platform
helping individuals, companies and universities improve
penetration testing skills. 
The platform is free for students and
university professors. 

Exercises are updated on
daily basis and progress of the user is tracked and awarded with
points, ranks and badges. 

They are performed in a
realistic environment, against a dedicated web
application instance or an executable that should be reverse
engineered.

It includes dedicated challenges for SQL injection, like [SQL Injection Fundamentals](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/33) and a fresh drop - [Blind SQL Injection](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/177).

Some Web exercises require combining SQL injection with other vulnerabilities.
